General Lab Report Guidelines:
* All Lab Reports must be typed and turned in on Canvas on the given due date. Late assignments
will not be accepted.
* Each lab report should have a cover sheet that includes your name, date, lab number and title.
* Your report need only contain items requested in the In-Lab Report boxes. All questions should be
answered in detail. You do not need to rephrase the lab procedure.
* Make sure all plots are clearly titled and axes are labeled.
* All Matlab code should be properly commented. Make sure all Matlab code printouts indicate the
purpose of the function or script.
